    <h2>WIRED: Swiss company Verity Studios has developed an algorithm that helps autonomous drones to retain control if one or two rotors become disabled</h2>

    <div class="txt intro">
      <h3>Even with a sophisticated flight management and tracking systems, drones can sometimes break or encounter unexpected obstacles. Companies are working on fixes here. Zipline uses ballistic parachutes to prevent its fixed-wing electric drones from going splat. Google’s Wing uses machine learning-based algorithms to locate safe delivery points away from trees, buildings, and power lines. Swiss company Verity Studios has developed an algorithm that helps autonomous drones to retain control if one or two rotors become disabled.</h3>
      <p>When that happens, drones start to spin uncontrollably&mdash;so Verity&rsquo;s system, called Failsafe, capitalizes on that spinning, working with it to stabilize the craft and regain control. According to company founder Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea, this can be done almost instantly. &ldquo;When Failsafe is triggered, the drone will recover in a space of 2 meters or less and remains fully controllable in this novel spinning mode,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The operator can then manually navigate the drone to an appropriate landing location, or in the case of autonomous flight, you can ask the drone to &lsquo;return home&rsquo; and it will navigate to its original take-off location and land using GPS.&rdquo;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/drone-delivery-services-are-actually-finally-almost-here/">Read the full article here</a></p>

      <h3>Autonomous drone swarm leaders offer low cost, weightless, and easily-integrated algorithms that drastically reduce failure rates</h3>
      <p>Verity Studios AG, a pioneer in autonomous drones, has launched an integration program for their Failsafe technology for quadcopters. The patented Failsafe solution provides powerful and cost-effective safety enhancements to any consumer and commercial quadcopter drone platform. This program allows drone manufacturers to easily implement the Failsafe algorithm into their drones as a standalone or complementary safety solution to guard against the most common cause of system-error crashes: propulsion system failures.<br /><br /></p>

      <p>Verity&rsquo;s Failsafe provides the first line of defense against propulsion system failures at little to no cost to the consumer, significantly increasing the safety and reliability of any quadrotor. When a Failsafe-enabled drone has a propulsion system failure, instead of spinning out of control and crashing to the ground, the drone stays in the air, stabilizing itself using sophisticated algorithms. It can then be safely navigated to an appropriate landing location. This type of disaster mitigation has never been achieved or implemented by manufacturers, forcing customers to pay for expensive retrofit systems, like parachutes, in an attempt to make their drones safer. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190228005901/en/Verity-Studios-Launches-Software-Algorithm-Drones-Dramatically">Read the full article here</a></p>

    <div class="txt intro">
      <h3>Head of Systems & Controls Flavio Fontana</h3>
      <p>Flavio Fontana grew up in Murten, Switzerland. Because of his early passion and fascination for model airplanes, he studied Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zurich. During his studies he worked at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), in the research group of Verity&rsquo;s founder Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea. Flavio got his master&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2015, Flavio was looking for a new challenge. He&rsquo;d heard about Verity from Markus Hehn, his former colleague from IDSC and co-founder and CTO of Verity Studios. Flavio was excited about the combination of intelligent systems and drone technology, so Verity was a good fit. Applying this technology in the field of live entertainment was completely new for him, and it made the job even more exciting: &ldquo;Our indoor drone show system is used in shows all around the world. Over the years I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to contribute to many spectacular shows.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Currently he leads the Systems and Controls team at Verity Studios. &ldquo;Often&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;people ask me what I do in my job. It is easier to explain if I start with what I don&rsquo;t do. I don&rsquo;t design or build the drones. I don&rsquo;t create the choreographies and light patterns. In my job I develop the brain of the drone. It means I develop systems that ensure the drones follow their flight paths accurately. In addition to this I have created a highly sophisticated safety concept for drones. This enables the drones to react to problems intelligently and prevents catastrophic outcomes. For example, the drone can detect a failed motor and switch to a different control strategy that allows the drone to fly out of the show and to land safely backstage.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

    <div class="txt">
      <p>Flavio said one of the best parts of his job is the interdisciplinary nature of his work: &ldquo;It covers the full spectrum: from developing an idea on the whiteboard; to sitting in front of the computer; to finally creating a robot that flies.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Flavio also appreciates the varied and interesting challenges he has at Verity Studios: &ldquo;At Verity I have the opportunity to contribute from early on and shape the product. I am also very excited about the market we operate in. My two personal highlights are last year&rsquo;s Circus Knie tour and the current Metallica tour. I love to be in an arena with 20,000 people and see our drones perform a light show with a huge band like Metallica playing underneath.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Flavio Fontana is just one of the many talented people at Verity Studios.

      <h3>With an estimated 1 billion viewers across the globe, the show is the most-watched TV program in the world. This year, Chinese lantern drones took flight above 70 dancers and famous singers Sun Nan and Jason Zhang.</h3>
      <p>ZURICH&ndash; February 6, 2019 &ndash; <a href="">Verity Studios</a> AG, the global leader in indoor drone systems, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://keeymedia.com/">Keey Media</a>, a leading smart entertainment company in China, announced today that 88 Verity Studios drones were chosen to feature in the CCTV New Year&rsquo;s Gala.&nbsp;<br /><br />The CCTV (China Central Television) New Year&rsquo;s Gala is the world&rsquo;s most-watched TV program. This event was broadcast live to an estimated 1 billion viewers across the globe. With 88 Lucie&reg; micro drones flying over performers in red Chinese lantern costumes, this is the largest number of costumed drones ever seen in a performance.<br /><br />&nbsp;Sponsored by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, a leading social media platform in Asia, the show opens to &ldquo;The Distance of Time&rdquo;, sung by popular singer Sun Nan and up-and-coming pop star Jason Zhang. As the song builds, 88 Lucie micro drones fly from the back of the stage like butterflies to dance above the 50 performers dressed as blossoming cherry trees. <br /><br />&ldquo;This stunning performance proves how compelling drones can be. More than just flying lights, we&rsquo;ve shown that costumes can transform this technology into moving sculptures. This is the first large-scale performance ever done with drone costumes,&rdquo; said Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea, founder of Verity and co-founder of Amazon Robotics.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Chinese lantern costumes adorning the Lucie micro drones were all designed and produced by the world&rsquo;s only drone costume designer and Verity employee, L&eacute;a Pereyre. Pereyre creates the costume design in CAD software before laser-cutting the materials and assembling the costumes. The drones feature special guards that have pre-defined slots to easily attach costume elements. This concept makes it easy to quickly create large numbers of costumes and transform drones into moving pieces of scenography, props and even characters.</p>

It&rsquo;s been fantastic to work alongside Lune Rouge Entertainment, the new company created by Guy Lalibert&eacute;, founder of Cirque du Soleil, and help the team there deliver their first-ever show in the Middle East.<br /><br />&ldquo;Verity Studios is constantly looking to push the boundaries of drone technology as a creative medium and Talisman is a compelling example of what can be achieved by incorporating drone technology with other, more traditional effects. We&rsquo;ll continue to pioneer industry-changing developments for the live events market.&rdquo;<br /><br />The light show utilizes a swarm of Verity Studio&rsquo;s unique Lucie&reg; micro drones. Weighing just 50g, they are fitted with high intensity, pre-programmable RGBW lights and can be safely flown above the heads of artists and audiences in virtually any indoor environment. <br /><br />The Lucie micro drones fly their pre-programmed choreographies autonomously, meaning a single operator can launch any number of drones. Enabling the micro drones to locate themselves in space and perform their choreographies is Verity&rsquo;s proprietary indoor positioning system. As part of this system, Kedge&trade; localization units accurately define the boundaries of the flight space and act as satellites in what is effectively an indoor GPS. <br /><br />The system can be integrated with stage architecture and offers clients ultimate flexibility, with no need for carpets, cameras or line of sight. The turnkey system means sophisticated shows can be operated directly by client staff.</p>

      <h3>Mechanical Intern in the Hardware Department</h3>
      <p>Laura started working at Verity in June 2018 after finishing her studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. Finding this internship at Verity was pure luck, as working in the entertainment industry is far removed from the traditional engineering companies she expected to work at after her studies.<br /><br />Born in Colombia, growing up in the US and doing a semester abroad in France, Laura has diverse cultural experience, which helped her adapt to living in Switzerland and working in a multicultural environment. <br /><br />Laura works in the hardware department, where she has her own short and long-term product design projects. She is tasked with developing creative solutions for running quality and performance tests, writing documentation on new designs and assisting in the transfer between the design engineering and manufacturing teams. Laura enjoys working closely with the manufacturing team and being involved in testing and calibrating the Lucie&reg; micro drones.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the things Laura likes about working at Verity is the team spirit and the work ethic. &ldquo;We all work extremely hard to make our company world-renowned, and I am excited to be part of the show. I like that the work is challenging, and I see the results of my hard work. I also like working alongside driven people. But the best part is the fun energetic group of interns.&rdquo;<br /><br />Unlike many internships, interns at Verity are given a lot of autonomy and responsibility. &ldquo;My favorite part of my job is designing important drone components on my own. I get to come up with a new solution to a problem that has never been solved before. I manage my own time and resources, but I have to work diligently because my work matters.&rdquo;<br /><br />Laura says that despite having to move halfway around the world, she is happy she made the leap. &ldquo;Joining Verity was one of the boldest and best decisions I have made.&rdquo;<br /><br />Laura Arciniegas is just one of the many talented people at Verity Studios.

Braun, who has worked with METALLICA since 1994, talked about his latest creation: "This band hasn't stopped touring in 30 years, and they sell albums like crazy. When they announced 'WorldWired', they wanted to take the live shows to a whole new level. I did some sketches and showed to Lars [Ulrich, drums] and he was very excited.

      <h3>Concerts can be boring. Typically, you’ve got an artist on stage singing songs and stuff, and then a bunch of spotlights beaming columns of color through some fake smoke. But something new is on the horizon, and it’s equal parts creepy and futuristic.</h3>
      <p>Swarms of artificially intelligent drones are starting to show up on stages around the world. Some, like the ones on Drake's latest tour,&nbsp;of are tiny flying lights that float above the stage. Others, like&nbsp;a recent Cirque du Soleil experience, featured more complex aircraft outfitted with lampshades that produced an almost ghostly effect. Metallica&nbsp;even has its own drone show. This might sound gimmicky at first, but when you see them live, it&rsquo;s thrilling to see these little aircraft appear out of nowhere, if only because you can&rsquo;t figure out how they work.<br /><br />Gizmodo recently sat down with&nbsp;Verity Studios, one of the companies leading the way on entertainment drones, and got a behind the scenes look at the technology. The company&rsquo;s founder, Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea, actually co-founded Kiva Systems, a company acquired by Amazon in 2012 that now functions as Amazon Robotics.&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t hard to see how Verity Studios&rsquo; had some parallels with the autonomous robots that help pick packages in fulfillment centers, too.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gizmodo.com/how-swarms-of-super-intelligent-drones-are-taking-over-1829638441">Read the full article here</a></p>

      <h3>When the setlist on Drake’s current tour rolls around to two particular songs, “Elevate” and “Look Alive,” 200 backup dancers rush onto the stage to twirl in choreographed fashion above the rapper’s head.</h3>
      <p>They&rsquo;re miniature autonomous drones, made by Zurich-based indoor drone company Verity Studios, which custom-designed the tech for the Canadian rapper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aubrey and the Three Amigos&rdquo; tour. At a demonstration of the micro drones in New York City last month amid Drake&rsquo;s multiple tour stops in town, Verity&rsquo;s founder Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea &mdash; an engineering professor and entrepreneur who also was the founder of Kiva Systems, which is now Amazon Robotics &mdash; explained how the set-up works: Each of the tiny devices, which weigh less than a slice of bread and are equipped with powerful lights, deploys from a net that&rsquo;s set up in front of the stage but hidden from audience view, and follows pre-set choreography made by Verity and Drake&rsquo;s creative team. Verity&rsquo;s proprietary tech allows the drones to also fly autonomously, rearranging themselves as Drake moves and avoiding collision with other people or objects, and the whole affair is set up and broken down at each venue by the touring team.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/drake-tour-backup-dancers-sentient-drones-718932/">Read the full article here</a></p>

      <h3>Drake's tech-filled concerts use drones as backup dancers</h3>
      <p>At Drake's concert at Madison Square Garden Tuesday night, the air was filled with more than just the roar of 18,000 fans.<br /><br />There were also 88 micro drones flying around the rapper during two songs in his two-hour show, synced up with his tracks Elevate and Look Alive. They hovered around with bright lights, changing colors from red to blue to white, like a swarm of large fireflies twinkling above the rapper.<br /><br />While it may not have been the most eye-catching display -- at one point the stage transformed into a giant iPhone X scrolling through Instagram, and then there was the floating Ferrari above the crowd -- it was likely the most technologically innovative stunt in a show filled with spectacles. That's because unlike other drone shows, this mini-Air Force was programmed to take flight autonomously.<br /><br />The elaborate choreography was coordinated between Drake's production team and Verity Studios, a Swiss company&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180605006104/en/Verity-Studios%C2%AE-Raises-18-Million-Series-Financing">that boasts investments</a>&nbsp;from Sony and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/kitty-hawk-flyer-electric-ultralight/">Kitty Hawk, the flying car startup</a>&nbsp;from Google's founder Larry Page.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/drakes-tech-filled-concert-is-using-drones-as-back-up-dancers/">Read the full article here</a></p>

      <h3>Drake lights up his live performances with a drone show</h3>
      <p>On a sticky late-August night in New York, Drake has chosen to share the stage with a non-human entity. As he bounces around the stage during &ldquo;Elevate,&rdquo; a cloud of drones illuminates the dark space above him.<br /><br />Drake is an artist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17518846/drake-scorpion-baby-pusha-t-social-media-internet-lyrics">shaped by the internet</a>, one whose latest meme-frenzy of a song, &ldquo;In My Feelings,&rdquo; defined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786654/spotify-drake-in-my-feelings-song-of-the-summer-meme-kiki-do-you-love-me">the entire summer</a>&nbsp;through dance challenges and memes. It&rsquo;s not surprising that the artist would incorporate buzzy, high-tech entertainment into his tours. It is shocking that he&rsquo;s still one of the few stage performers to do so, given the popularity of the aerial devices.<br /><br />Drone company Verity Studios has been steadily building its live performance profile. Its drones have flown in performances by Cirque du Soleil and Metallica. But the Canadian rapper represents a new high point, says Verity founder Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea. &ldquo;Drake is about as good as we can get.&rdquo;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17793364/drake-live-concert-drone-show-performance-elevate">Read the full article here</a></p>

    <h2>Team Verity Spotlight: Luca Gherardi</h2>
  </section>
  <section class="contentblock txtOnly centerOverflowed">
    <div class="txt intro">
      <h3>Head of Software Engineering Luca Gherardi</h3>
      <p>Luca Gherardi became employee #1 after joining Verity in 2014 as a software engineer. Originally from Italy, Luca moved to Switzerland in 2013 to do his post-doctoral research at ETH after meeting <a href="/news/raffaello-dandrea">Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea.</a> At ETH, he worked in the Flying Machine Arena under D&rsquo;Andrea, who then asked Luca to join Verity shortly after it was founded.<br /><br />As the head of software engineering, Luca is involved in all aspects of software design and development. His work centers more specifically on the software behind Verity&rsquo;s proprietary localization system, which is what enables our drones to fly autonomously indoors.<br /><br />What excites him about his role at Verity is the diversity and complexity of the challenges he is faced with. The responsibilities in the software team range from the embedded design of drivers for sensors and micro-controller peripherals, to the development of the application user interfaces for the client-facing software we run our shows from.<br /><br />&ldquo;We work on problems that haven&rsquo;t been addressed before. Most of the time, you can&rsquo;t just research something and use existing solutions. For us, it&rsquo;s more about designing new algorithms or taking inspiration from best practice techniques from other domains and tailoring them to solve our unique challenges.&rdquo;<br /><br />The elimination of a single point of failure is a key requirement for any engineering done at Verity. With system consisting of hundreds of different components that cooperate to achieve a common goal, the engineering team works to ensure each component is important but not critical.&nbsp; Though requiring a lot of resources, it also makes the system very robust and reliable.<br /><br />&ldquo;Designing a system like this requires consideration of all the possible problems, safety and security concerns from the beginning. It takes a lot of effort, but it&rsquo;s a big reward when you see that our system could operate on Broadway for a year for 400 shows without any problems.&rdquo;<br /><br />Luca was also involved in the production of <a href="/work/sparked">SPARKED</a>, a video collaboration between Cirque du Soleil, ETH Zurich and Verity Studios.<br /><br /></p>

      <p>So, what is a software engineer with a post-doc from ETH doing at a live events company? Unlike many other opportunities in the engineering field, the work done at Verity is unique, challenging&hellip; and used by bands like <a href="/work/metallicatour">Metallica</a>.<br /><br />&ldquo;We create an innovative product that is unique in the world of live events. Our indoor drones are seen by millions, and people love it. It&rsquo;s really rewarding to be at a show and see the reactions of the audience. In a high-end show, people expect to see lights, smoke effects and maybe fireworks, but no one expects to see drones."</p>

Everyone is ready to help when needed.&rdquo;<br /><br />Luca Gherardi is just one of the many talented people at Verity Studios.

      <h3>New funding allows “flying machines” to perform at more live events, Verity Studios founder Raffaello D’Andrea tells Robotics Business Review</h3>
      <p>Verity Studios might be the only robotics company that can say it has toured with Metallica and performed with Cirque du Soleil. Since 2014, the company has produced autonomous indoor drone shows for those groups and others, including Madison Square Garden, and Princess Cruises.<br /><br />In June, the company <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180605006104/en/Verity-Studios%C2%AE-Raises-18-Million-Series-Financing">raised $18 million in Series A funding</a>, led by Fontinalis Partners, with participation from Airbus Ventures, Sony Innovation Fund, and Kitty Hawk. The company said it would use the funding to expand its live events business, focusing on U.S. growth, as well as expanding into other commercial verticals.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s founder, Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea, was one of the co-founders of Kiva Systems, a pioneer in the mobile robotics arena that was acquired by Amazon in 2012.

      <h3>The back-up dancers of the future: a swarm of Lucie® micro drones are on the road with Drake around North America.</h3>
      <p>ZURICH&ndash; August 15, 2018 &ndash; <a href="">Verity Studios</a> AG, the global leader in indoor drone technology, announced today that swarms of Lucie micro drones are performing with Drake in his 2018 Aubrey &amp; the Three Migos Tour. &nbsp;Grammy award-winning Canadian artist Drake is one of the best-selling rappers of the 21st century. Performing to audiences of more than 50,000 people, his previous North American tour broke the record for the highest grossing hip-hop tour of all time. This tour is a first for the Lucie micro drones, debuting with a rap artist on the back of touring with rock band <a href="/work/metallicatour">Metallica</a> and <a href="/work/circus-knie">Circus Knie</a>.&nbsp;Elevate, a song on Drake&rsquo;s new album Scorpion, opens with the micro drones swarming onto the stage to surround Drake in a cloud of lights to the roar of the audience. In another guest appearance, the Lucie micro drones create a glittering wave in the song Look Alive before forming a red 3D cross that rotates around Drake.</p>

      <h3>"All you see is magic"</h3>
      <p>Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea, founder of Verity and co-founder of Amazon Robotics, said unlike many other show drones, Verity&rsquo;s drones are operated solely by the Drake tour staff and perform their choreographies autonomously. &nbsp;&ldquo;People often describe technologies they&rsquo;ve never seen before as &lsquo;magic&rsquo;. This is also how people talk about our drones when they see them live for the first time. By bringing robotics and AI to live events, we are creating magic. It&rsquo;s spectacular to see a swarm of drones performing a perfectly synchronized aerial ballet without a single drone pilot in sight. Of course, what&rsquo;s powering this performance is advanced technology, but when you sit in the audience, all you see is magic.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>"What the teams created together is visually stunning"</h3>
      <p>As part of its creative services, Verity employs drone choreographers and drone costume designers to bring its clients&rsquo; visions to life. The creative concept for the drone choreography came from conversations with the Drake creative team. &nbsp;&ldquo;When the Drake team approached us, they said they wanted something that had never been seen before. Our drone choreographers worked in partnership with Drake&rsquo;s creative team to come up with various concepts for the show, like geometric shapes and drone tornadoes, before deciding on the final choreographies. What the teams created together is visually stunning. We relish pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible with our technology when pursuing our clients&rsquo; creative vision,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Andrea.<br /><br />Since it was founded in 2014, Verity has been bringing cutting edge robotics and AI technology to live events. With over 30,000 flights under their belts, Verity&rsquo;s autonomous drones have performed in more than 20 countries and in a variety of venues, including on Broadway in <a href="work/paramour">Cirque du Soleil&rsquo;s Paramour</a> and at the New York Knicks pre-game shows at <a href="work/madison-square-garden">Madison Square Garden.</a> &nbsp;To learn more about Verity and see videos of previous shows, visit <a href="">www.veritystudios.com</a>.&nbsp;To attend the press event &ldquo;Drake: behind the drones&rdquo; in New York on the 28th of August 2018, contact <a href="mailto:media@veritystudios.com">media@veritystudios.com</a>.&nbsp;To purchase tickets or get more information about the 2018 Aubrey &amp; the Three Migos Tour, visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.drakeofficial.com">www.drakeofficial.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Lucie® micro drones take center stage in the popular Andrew Lloyd Weber musical in Bochum, Germany. </h3>
      <p>Verity Studios AG, the global leader in indoor drone technology, and Mehr! Entertainment, Germany&rsquo;s largest theater group, announced last week that 28 Lucie micro drones are performing in STARLIGHT EXPRESS as part of the musical&rsquo;s 30th year on stage.<br /><br />The rock musical STARLIGHT EXPRESS tells  the story of a child&rsquo;s toy trains magically coming to life and racing  against each other to be crowned the fastest engine in the world. Underdog Rusty ultimately wins the race and the heart of first-class coach Pearl when he is inspired by the legend of the Starlight Express.<br /><br />Verity&rsquo;s Lucie micro drones create a magical moment&nbsp; as they circle and interact with Rusty in the emotional pinnacle of the show: the Starlight Sequence.<br /><br />Managing Director Burkhard Koch said the micro drones played a key part in the reimagination of the musical for its 30th year on stage. &ldquo;STARLIGHT EXPRESS is the longest running musical in the world. It even has the Guinness World Record for the most visitors to a musical in a single theater. To keep surprising people, we needed to create a spectacle, a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moment. Verity&rsquo;s sparkling drones bring some unexpected magic to the show.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />The 28 Lucie micro drones perform their choreographies autonomously and are operated entirely by STARLIGHT EXPRESS staff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic that such a sophisticated system is so easy for us to use,&rdquo; said Koch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve used the system for 13 public performances now, and we haven&rsquo;t had a single hiccup.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Verity&rsquo;s  drones have played starring roles in other musicals, notably as dancing  lampshades on Broadway in Paramour by Cirque du Soleil. But this is the  first time 28 Lucie micro drones have completely circled an actor on stage. &ldquo;Immersive experiences are becoming increasingly popular as a form of artistic expression. But when  we&rsquo;re flying our drones so close to performers or audience members,  safety is of utmost importance,&rdquo; said Verity founder Raffaello D&rsquo;Andrea.  &ldquo;This is why we have designed our  indoor drone system with safety and reliability in mind. To date, our  drones have completed over 30,000 autonomous flights, safely above  people, in more than 20 countries. It&rsquo;s a testament to the safety and  reliability of our technology.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />The new&nbsp; STARLIGHT EXPRESS opened to a crowd of over 1600 on the 12th of June after six successful previews. The 2018 season will continue with 7 shows per week from Wednesday till Sunday.&nbsp;<br /><br />To purchase tickets or get more information about Starlight Express in Bochum, visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.starlight-express.de">www.starlight-express.de</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Underwater UV Costumes </h2>

  <section class="contentblock txtOnly centerOverflowed">
    <div class="txt intro">
      <h3>Drone costume designer, Léa Pereyre has recently been exploring the effect of UV costumes on our Lucie® micro drones. The costumes, though still in development, can produce the effect of underwater creatures.   </h3>
      <p>Drone costume designer L&eacute;a Pereyre was prompted to start exploring UV costumes when investigating a potential collaboration with a night club. &ldquo;I tried to  understand the elements typically found in a night club venue that I could use to enhance our drones&rsquo; performance. It ended up being nearly obvious that using UV light with UV reactive material is perfect for creating flying sculptures&rdquo;.<br /><br />The effect of UV paint and reactive materials is impactful, even from a distance. It opens the possibility of turning our very light and safe Lucie micro drones into floating characters, props and scenery.</p>

      <p>L&eacute;a can see how this effect can offer many new opportunities. &ldquo;First, UV light helps you to focus on a specific element. You can make select elements appear or disappear which helps create more magic around the costumes.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Even without a costume, painting the Lucie guard in UV paint also creates a stunning effect. &ldquo;You could also imagine a double use of our Lucie micro drones,&rdquo; said L&eacute;a. &ldquo;If  the guard is covered by UV paint, the drones could perform their light  show and then suddenly transform into flying sculptures thanks to a  switch of ambient light.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>Want to add some extra wow-factor to a live event? Drone shows are  transforming the landscape and leaving audiences blown away. Leading  provider Verity Studios discusses its soaring appeal.</h3>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re looking to create something truly deserving of the words  &lsquo;wow&rsquo; and &lsquo;factor&rsquo; for your next live event, you might want to consider  the possibilities provided by drones.<br /><br />The market for drones  (outside of a military setting) for personal and commercial use has  exploded in recent years with sales forecasts predicting sales of nearly  30 million units by 2021. <br /><br />One of the fastest growth areas is in  the commercial space (170,000 sales in 2017, up from 110,000 in 2016*)  and the use of drones for LED &lsquo;drone shows&rsquo; has become big business and  widely adopted in the entertainment industry. <br /><br />Recent high profile examples include the 2018 Winter Olympics opening  ceremony in PyeongChang, at which Intel performed a choreographed light  display using 1,218 drones to create various animations, including the  Olympic rings.<br /><br />Drones were also used to promote the release of Wonder Woman on DVD,  lighting up the LA sky with various related imagery associates with the  film. But it&rsquo;s not just large open outdoor spaces where drone  shows are taking place, with musicians, theatre productions and even  airports using drones to wow visitors with a barely believable  performance more akin to special FX in a science fiction movie than  reality.  <br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.installation-international.com/technology/drone-powered-led-light-shows-taking-entertainment-levels-to-new-heights">Read full article</a></p>

      <h3>Verity Studios adds 99 micro drones to “Moth Into Flame” on Metallica’s WorldWired Tour.</h3>
      <p>Working in close collaboration with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.taittowers.com/">TAIT</a>, who custom built the in-the-round stage design for Metallica&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.metallica.com/tour">WorldWired Tour</a>,&nbsp;Verity Studios  provided the touring industry&rsquo;s first autonomous indoor drone swarm,  with 99 micro drones dancing like fireflies for the song, &ldquo;Moth Into  Flame.&rdquo; The set and stage design, designed by the show&rsquo;s director, Dan  Braun, features an immersive concert experience with a 44' x 44' square  main-stage equipped with several prop lifts located in the center of the  arena.<br /><br /><br />James Hetfield, lead singer and co-founder of Metallica, has wanted  to use drones in the show for several years, but as Braun points out, &ldquo;I  used to say they weren&rsquo;t safe, so we sort of got away from the idea,  but kept it on the back burner. Then I spoke with Adam Davis at TAIT,  and he told us about their relationship with Verity and about the  potential possibilities, and that&rsquo;s how we got into using drones on this  tour. As the show&rsquo;s designer and director, I thought we should put them  in &lsquo;Moth Into  Flame,&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s been a very successful song for the band  for a long time. And after the first night of the tour in Copenhagen,  James said the drones were great, so we were happy, and we always want  to keep the band happy.&rdquo;<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.livedesignonline.com/concerts/metallica-worldwired-tour-part-one">Read full article</a></p>

    <div class="txt intro">
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Drone show systems are advanced show automation systems designed for live performances that enable the control of one to potentially thousands of autonomous multirotors or other small flying machines. These novel systems enable the use of drones to extend the traditional palette of light, sound, stage effects, and human performers by choreographing the simultaneous movements of a multitude of flying objects in 3D space. This gives this technology the potential to fundamentally transform the live events experience. <br /><br />Emergent use cases for this technology include animation of flying characters, flying lighting displays, movement of stage props and scenographic elements, and the creation of flying robot actors and synthetic swarms. The key challenges for this new technology are safety and reliability. First solutions for the safe deployment of this technology exist, and avantgarde creators are embracing the possibilities offered by autonomous drones.<br /><br /><a href="https://veritystudios.cdn.prismic.io/veritystudios%2F872474f8-cf76-4bbe-a558-de935e847c8c_drone+shows+-+creative+potential+and+best+practices+-+20180116.pdf">Read the full whitepaper</a></p>
